            <p> It all began when two young professionals met one day in the middle of the street. A quick "welcome to the 
            neighborhood" conversation evolved into an everlasting friendship and marriage...<br>
            After several months of long distance calls and over the weekend road trips, I decided that I would ask 
            Heather to become my wife. So on a planned trip to Las Vegas, I took my chance to make it a memorable trip.
            In front of the Bellagio Hotel, after walking around with a ring box in my socks for several hours, I asked Heather to marry me!

                And on June 7th, 2018, we celebrated 10 years of marriage! We have had so memorable moments along the way.
                I could not have chosen a better person to spend the rest of my life with. I truly adore and love my wife and I
                for many more years with her!
